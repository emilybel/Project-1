Supply and Demand Network Flow Problem
An LP of a directed, connected graph of m nodes and n arcs. 
Each arc has a known capacity and unit cost. 
Each node has a fixed external flow.
Determine the minimum cost plan to send flow through the network to satisfy the supply and demand requirements.

To run this code, enter the directory where the supply_demand_NFP.py script is located.

Copy and paste the following line into the terminal. Replace "50" with the actual number of nodes for the problem.

python supply_demand_NFP.py -n 50 -f Network -l Network -d 1
